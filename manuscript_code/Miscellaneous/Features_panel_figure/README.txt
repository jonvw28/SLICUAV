The figure in the manuscript is constructed from various plots around the central image (extracted from SLIC superpixels from landscape mapping). The plots are a mix of artificial data and real stats on the included image. These were then manually put together in an informative way. This is a qualitative illustraion figure, but the components to go into the final version can be recreated using the code in this directory.
